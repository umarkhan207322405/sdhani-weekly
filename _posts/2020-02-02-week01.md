## Week 1 Blog Post

I decided to take Open Source this semester for several reasons--the main being that I'm a morning person, and Open Source is one of the few morning CS electives offered at Hunter. I also decided to take the course because I've always been interested in contributing to an Open Source project, but never really knew where to start. I doubted for a long time that I was qualified enough to start anywhere. Afterall, there's still so much to learn. I'm hoping that by the end of the course I will learn how I can use my degree skillset to give back to the world--particularly in the area of education. 

I've had a long-standing interest in improving people's access to educational resources. I grew up in a community where a lot of my peers dropped out because they lacked the resources necessary to thrive in the school system.  This gave me an early perspective on the importance of an educational system *for all*. When I got selected for a top high school, I noticed the richer academic experience I received and instantly wondered if I could've benefited from such an experience earlier in my educational career. 

Now that I'm in the course, I'm excited to fulfill some of my personal passions aside from all things Computer Science. One day I would like to contribute to free and open source educational software/resources so that people who can not afford to purchase competitive products can use them openly to expand their knowledge. I firmly believe that everyone has a right to a rich educational experience no matter what barriers they face (age, language, economic status, etc.) and would love to be a part of a community that makes that happen.
