## `if(only_open_source) {...}`

Would I want to work at a company that *only* produced open source software? Honestly, it's hard to say right now. As I become more familiar with Open Source communities I want to tread lightly. It's easy to be absorbed by an echo chamber of thought and belief, and I would want to diversify my exposure to Open Source projects and communities a little bit more before deciding if this is the space I want to thrive in as a budding Computer Scientist and Software developer. That being said, I've looked into Red Hat multiple times before taking this class or even realizing that it was one of the most financially successful Open Source companies in the world. So maybe I already do have some sort of predisposition to Open Source companies by default...:thinking::wink:

### `$ cd Next.js`

### `$ git log --reverse`

#### `commit message Tuesday April 26` :sound::

Today team TON and I discussed project updates, shared a few roadblocks that we ran into with our sprint tasks, and assigned more tasks for the coming week. Michelle and I decided that we would divide up the tasks involved with rendering our team example. This section of task is one of the final tasks that we need to complete before we can deploy our example and submit a PR to Next.js. :blush:

#### `commit message Wednesday April 27` :film_projector::

Today, Michelle and I had a Zoom meeting tto discuss the specifics about rendering our example and break down all of the complexities associated with it. Once we defined a set of *mini*-tasks that needed to be completed to sucessfully complete our example's rendering, we divded up the work between the two of us based on interests and skills. I look forward to collaborating with Michelle on this more closely over the next week.

## [Musings on business models for open source software](https://spot.livejournal.com/327801.html) :thinking:

While it should be noted that Tom Callaway's perspective on Open Source business models is biased towards Red Hat's, it's interesting to hear his reasoning behind the company's financial success sans an *open core* concept. I learned a few things by reading these *musings* :smile::

- ***How other companies with "open source" sections make money :moneybag:***. Out of all the models that Callaway introduces, I found the FUD model to be the most amusing because it relies on a client's "fear, uncertainty, and doubt":scream: in a company's open source code to profit from *"commercial"* licenses. While it does make sense, its message almost feels anti-open source. At least that's how Callaway is selling it to us :joy:. I was also surprised to find out that this was the business model for MongoDB, but it ultimately explained the proprietary vibes I got from using the program.

- ***Not everything that sounds too good to be true is. :shamrock:*** Callaway touts this idyllic scenario where not only can anyone look at and contribute to Red Hat's codebase, but Red Hat itself can profit from it. This profit comes from what Callaway describes as the *"value beyond binary deliverables"* that Red Hat gives its customers because of the expansive development pool that it has access to by design. In Red Hat's case, that's a win-win. Unlimited free collaborators and a sizeable profit margin.

## [Election fraud: Is there an open source solution?](https://opensource.com/article/19/9/voting-fraud-open-source-solution)  :bank:

At first glance, I would've said that an Open Source solution to election fraud was outlandish. My reasoning would've been based around *what I think I know* about federal government protocols and code security (which I'll admit is not a lot :laughing:). After reading this article though, I'm starting to think it's possible. The Open Source Election Technology (OSET) Institute, whose founding story is interesting in itself, is championing the idea of technology that is made to keep our elections *honest* and free from *interference*. The global scope of the project is impressive, although there does seem to be some kind of "legitimizing" process for potential contributors to the code. I wonder to what capacity (if any) that these *approvals* of "legitimate" contributors hurts OSET's ability to form completely open and diverse communities. On a different note, since the company plans on releasing their tech in the public domain, I'm interested to know how they plan on handling liability concerns over the tech. Overall it seems like a super interesting project.

## Contributions Made This Week :snowflake:

*I have been feeling a bit under the weather this week, so in the interest of rest and rejuventaion, I have decided to take a **temporary** break from contributions.*

I did look into the [2019 Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 (2019-nCoV) Data Repository by Johns Hopkins CSSE](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) project a little more though. I used the filter tool on the project to better understand the kinds of PRs were approved in the project to gain a better insight on the kind of help JHU was looking for in maintaining the repo. 

<img src="https://hunter-college-ossd-spr-2020.github.io/sdhani-weekly/assets/filter-JHU-merged.png">

I noticed that only ***13*** [PR's were merged](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+is%3Amerged) into the project since it was created. This is out of the ***179*** [PR's that are closed](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+) for the project. Therefore I have concluded that this project either isn't looking for contributions from the community, or doesn't have the time/resources necessary to dedicate to interacting with the community.  

**Some updates on last week's PR:**
I'm the #39 Contributor on Cloudflare's Worker's Docs!! *There were only 52 contributors in the project to begin with, but who's counting? :joy::joy:*
