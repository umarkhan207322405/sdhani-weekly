# Four score and *four weeks ago*, 

:crystal_ball: I used my magical abilities to predict the future. How accurate my [prediction](https://hunter-college-ossd-spr-2020.github.io/sdhani-weekly/week08/) was is probably telling of how powerful a sourcerer I am. Long story short--I don't think I'll be giving Harry Potter a run for his money anytime *soon* :joy:.

## ***Timing is Everything.*** :leaves:
                  
                  
Exactly one hour before  **[Gil Yehuda's](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gilyehuda)**  presentation on *How to make money by contributing to Open Source projects*, I found out that the summer internship (that I was enthusiastically looking forward to) was cancelled amidst the growing concerns over a second wave of COVID-19. 

In a nutshell, ***I understood.*** Heck, I'd say some small part of me even expected it. But I was still holding out, hoping that I was wrong. It's a material thing, really--an internship. In many ways a small price to pay, if I price was demanded. Knowing that though, didn't stop the disappointment from creeping in nor the stress about summer unemployment from growing. I remembered feeling so surprised and *lucky* when I initially got the offer 7 weeks ago. It was the first *real* competitive offer that I had ever gotten. In a sea of rejections, that one acceptance was like finding Willy Wonka's *golden ticket* :chocolate_bar:. In many ways it was more than an offer or an opportunity to grow. It was validation. Validation that I could actually pursue a CS career and thrive. 

In the newfound vacancy of the summer, Gil Yehuda's, perhaps provacative and brazen, talk about Open Source and portfolio building was just thing I needed to get the creative :art: juices :juice: flowing again. I particularly found his advice on contributing to Open Source projects that were associated with companies you wanted to work at to be interesting. In fact, I started looking at the FOSS projects associated to the companies that I was applying to and realized that I was unintentionally judging companies that didn't contribute to the Open Source community :joy:. I also appreciated Yehuda's affirmation that skills aquired from FOSS contributions are transferrable to the workplace. He explained, that if you learned how to do a thing in one project, you could easily leverage your knowledge and understanding to accomplish something very similar in  another project. With many people struggling from unemployment, this kind of thinking :thinking: is invaluable.

## [Folding@Home's Covid19 Activity](https://foldingathome.org/covid19/) :alembic:

Folding Home is using computer simulations to understand how the protein in the COVID-19 virus is moving. They hope that this research will reveal *druggable* sites that they can use to treat the virus. Based on a similar research path they took with handling the Ebola virus, their methodology seems pretty cool and promising. They are requesting computing power as donations to the cause. I don't know much about chemical proteins, but it's clear that we still have much research to do on the virus. It's inspiring to see how people across a diverse range of occupations are coming together to make a difference in this trying time. :microscope:

### `sdhani@HunterOpenSource:~/TEAM_TON$ ./Run_TEAM_TON_Updates*`

|  Date   |  Progress |
|:------|:---|
|:artificial_satellite: `Tue Apr 07` | Discussed potential Next.js examples that we can contribute. Michelle suggested a Next.js + MongoDB :cloud: example, and I thought it was a great idea! Since I have some prior experience using MongoDB, I think I will be able to help fill any holes in understanding how to implement it with Next.js. |
|:vibration_mode: `Wed Apr 08` | I submitted a [PR](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/pull/11760) that was approved for another grammar mistake in the `with-docker` README file. Michelle submitted an [issue](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/issues/11756) asking for community feedback on contributing a Next.js + MongoDB :cloud: example. |
|:call_me_hand:  `Wed Apr 15` | Michelle got the go ahead for us to start working on the Next.js + MongoDB :cloud: example. It was time to set some hard deadlines and determine the workflow in which we should all contribute to that example. Our hard deadline is to complete this example, full-scale, in the next two weeks :timer_clock:. It is important that we discuss potential workflows, break down the parts of the project and organize them into what we need to get done. We set goals on what we should become familiar with in terms on using MongoDB :cloud: and databases and decided that we should start meeting more often until we make a PR for this example. |
|:bellhop_bell: `Fri Apr 17` | I shared a Trello Board for our project that I created with the team. I hope this makes our sprint tasks easier to understand and follow. We also discussed some workflow tradeoffs, and spent some time clarifying database concepts in general, with an emphasis on NoSQL MongoDB :cloud:. I drew a potential workflow diagram, but Michelle brought it to my attention that our [networks graph](https://github.com/hunter-college-ossd-spr-2020/next.js/network) looks a little off. After taking a look, I agreed with her :100:. So we thought it was time to get some feedback from Prof. Weiss before moving forward! |
|:crystal_ball: `Tue Apr 21` | I'm foreseeing a helpful meeting with Prof. Weiss coming up. Hopefully it will clear up some of our foundational problems and help us recalibrate our workflow so we can produce a quick turnaround with this Next.js example. |

## Contributions

I made a few blog edits to my peers blogs, and got to learn more about the issues that they were exploring! I also made some Wikipedia contributions to the [Therianthropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therianthropy) wiki-article. 

In my search for another internship, I've been learning new technologies. While working with Cloudflare's Open Source, *Wrangler* tool, I encountered a bug in their download process for npm. In true Open Source spirit I added a comment to one of their [issues](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler/issues/266) on it with a hack that fixed the issue for me. (It's worth noting though that after using that fix, I decided to go with another package manager installation series entirely.)
