## They say *Commit Early and Commit Often*...

*They say to **commit early and often** in the programming world...but when it comes to commiting to a FOSS project to work on for the rest of the semester, I think several things need to be considered before making the final plunge.*

#### `$ cd choosingSemesterProject`
#### `$ git log`

##### `commit message Monday March 02 2020`: 
Today I met with the team that I will be working on a FOSS project with for the rest of the semester. [@liulanz](https://github.com/liulanz), [@chislee0708](https://github.com/chislee0708), [@MichelleLucero](https://github.com/MichelleLucero). We decided that *[TEAMMATES](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates)* was an interesting project to work on as a group.

##### `commit message Thursday March 05 2020`: 
Today my team and I decided that contributing to *[TEAMMATES](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates)* would be unmanageable this semester given our team's skillsets. Upon closer inspection of the project's contributing docs and opened issues, the project is mostly geared towards Java, Angular and TypeScript contributions. Since none of us has experience in these technologies, we quickly ruled out the project. Unfortunately, *(or fortunately, depending on how you look at it)*, this sent us back into project evaluation mode. We spent a few hours separately searching for potential project's to contribute to today, and met for an hour to discuss what we wanted out of a project. We decided that we needed the project (in addition to meeting the project evaluation standards outlined [here](https://github.com/hunter-college-ossd-spr-2020/project-evaluation/blob/master/evaluation_template.md)), 
  1. Must have a lot of good first issues
  1. Must have a decent amount of activity level
  1. Must be welcoming
  1. Preferably interesting
  1. Preferably within our skillsets, with an explorative interest as a team in JavaScript

##### `commit message Friday March 06 2020`: 
Today I spent several hours searching for FOSS projects to contribute to based on my team's priorities. I started project evaluations for several of them but in the end, only finished three of them due to personal interests. Some of my teammates did the same, and we started a virtual discussion on which ones we were leaning towards. No verdict was made, but we easily eliminated a few of the choices since they were visibly weaker than other projects. |Cuts: [Ember.js](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js), [brackets](https://github.com/adobe/brackets), [Leaflet](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet), [Ghost](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost)]

##### `commit message Saturday March 07 2020 2:00PM`: 
Today I've realized that I spend a ridiculous amount of time on this class every week #thankyoulogging. I've determined that it's because I'm developing a passion for the FOSS contribution process...or blogging...or both. Today I narrowed down our project choices and proposed three finalists to the group (after a few more hours of close evaluation and consideration). We were between [Strapi](https://github.com/strapi/strapi), [Material-UI](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui), and [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js) for the better part of the day. Finally, after brutal consideration and due to overall group interests we decided to choose **Next.js** because it had a lot of good first issues to contribute to. This was a hard choice, because it seems like a perfect project ceases yet to exist out there for our team. 

##### `commit message Saturday March 07 2020 ~4:00PM`:
I forked the Next.js project into the class repo. Super excited to get started on this project :fingers-crossed:.

##### `commit message Saturday March 07 2020 9:00PM`: 
***I think I've been bamboozled***. I am currently running into a ton of errors in installing the **Next.js** project. In a true moment of weakness, I attempted the installation process for [material-ui](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) only to find that it was--at max--a 10 min process. That being said, I couldn't give up on yet another `commited` project, so I of course, stuck it out. As it turns out the [contributing.md](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/blob/canary/contributing.md) file that included a section on installing this project wasn't short because it was simple. In fact, it lacked sufficient documentation on the installation process for new contributors. What probably seemed like a straightforward and simple process to the authors of the file ended up costing me hours of sanity. *[@MichelleLucero](https://github.com/MichelleLucero) suggested that this file be our first contribution to the project...#brillantIdeas. [Improvements would include clearer documentation on the workflow, better support for cross-platform contributions #ubuntu, #linux, and a troubleshooting guide. A successful project should encourage contributions, not scare them off at Step 0. Installation].*

##### `commit message Sunday March 08 2020 5:00PM`: 
Ahhh, so this is what progress feels like. I *finally* got **Next.js** installed and running on my computer. Hopefully I don't run into any more missing module errors, corrupted file paths, or who knows what. I ran a few example files in the project and saw a lot of [puppies](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/canary/examples/amp-story)...that definetly made the entire process worth it :laugh: .
